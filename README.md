# 📊 Atliq Hardware - Ad-Hoc Insights SQL Challenge

Welcome to the **Ad-Hoc Insights SQL Project** based on a case study of *Atliq Hardware*, a leading computer hardware manufacturer. This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to derive actionable business insights from raw data.

## 🧩 Project Context

Atliq Hardware, with a solid footprint across India and international markets, realized a key gap: **a lack of quick, data-informed insights** for timely decision-making. To address this, 10 business questions were raised, aiming to uncover patterns in sales, pricing, manufacturing, customer behavior, and more.

To support the leadership with data-driven decisions, I extracted, analyzed, and presented insights using **SQL** and a **PowerPoint presentation**.

## 🗃️ Database Overview

The project uses a structured relational database with six main tables, capturing product, customer, pricing, sales, and manufacturing details:

- **dim_customer**: Contains customer info, including platform, channel, market, and region.
- **dim_product**: Includes product details like division, segment, category, and variant.
- **fact_sales_monthly**: Records monthly sales volume, along with product and customer references.
- **fact_gross_price**: Stores product prices per fiscal year before deductions.
- **fact_manufacturing_cost**: Captures production costs per product annually.
- **fact_pre_invoice_deductions**: Holds percentage-based deductions applied before invoicing.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand and answer 10 ad-hoc business questions using SQL.
- Explore relationships across multiple data tables.
- Identify key performance drivers from customer, product, pricing, and sales data.
- Present insights clearly and effectively for executive-level decision-making.
